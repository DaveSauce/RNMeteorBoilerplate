# RNMeteorBoilerplate
React Native and Meteor boilerplate. Includes setup for iOS, Android, and Web. Heavily influenced by https://github.com/spencercarli/react-native-meteor-boilerplate

After cloning project, be sure to run `npm install` from the `MeteorApp` and `RNApp` directories.


## Renaming project
Follow these instructions: http://blog.tylerbuchea.com/renaming-a-react-native-project/
You also need to create a new Bundle ID in xCode.

<!-- ## Oauth:
`touch MeteorApp/settings.json`

containing:

`{
  "oAuth": {
    "facebook": {
      "appId": "",
      "secret": ""
    },
    "github": {
      "clientId": "",
      "secret": ""
    },
    "twitter": {
      "consumerKey": "",
      "secret": ""
    }
  }
}`

Then add your keys. More instructions here: https://themeteorchef.com/recipes/roll-your-own-authentication/#tmc-setting-up-oauth-services -->
